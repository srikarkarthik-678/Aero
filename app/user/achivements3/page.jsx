We are excited to report that this workshop was a resounding success. Our lightweight, hand-launched Micro class plane demonstrated exceptional stability and efficiency in the air. Simultaneously, our larger, ground-takeoff Regular class UAV showcased its robust design and powerful performance. Seeing both our aircraft fly successfully has validated our engineering approach and gives us immense confidence as we move into the final stages of preparation for the main competition.</p>

                                The recent preparatory workshop served as the ultimate proving ground for our designs, and we are thrilled with the results. Watching our lightweight Micro class plane being launched by hand and then gracefully cutting through the air with remarkable steadiness was a pivotal moment. Its flight was a clear demonstration of a successful aerodynamic design, validating our focus on efficiency and low-drag construction. In stark contrast, the powerful roar of our Regular class UAV's engine during its confident takeoff run was equally gratifying. It climbed with authority and navigated its flight path precisely</p>
