At the recent SAE Aero Design Challenge (AADC), hosted at the prestigious KCG College of Engineering in Chennai, we proudly secured the 19th position. Facing a formidable field of 70 of the nation's brightest engineering teams, this accomplishment is far more than just a number. It stands as a powerful testament to the relentless dedication that fueled countless late nights in the workshop, the innovative design principles that guided our build, and the collaborative spirit that saw us through every challenge. Placing in the top tier of such a demanding national competition validates our engineering skills and firmly establishes our presence among the country's leading collegiate aero-design teams. We are incredibly proud of this result and what it represents for our team and our college.</p>

This process was a true test of our ability to apply classroom knowledge to a complex, real-world engineering problem. More than just a competition, this was an invaluable learning experience where our collaborative spirit truly shone, proving that our greatest strength lies in our ability to innovate and solve problems together as a cohesive unit.</p>
